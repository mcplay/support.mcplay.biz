# Rules
These are the rules for this Discord server. There are more important things to consider besides these, but I'll leave those to your common sense.

!> Please note that other rules may apply in some cases.

1. Pay respect to the other person.
  - Always be respectful to other users and don't create conflict. Your own self-control, not the server's staff, is the key to stopping the conflict.
2. Do not spam.
  - Spam has always been a problem in the online community. For many users, mass notification is a meaningless act.
3. Do not promote advertising.
  - Please don't advertise. The people on this server are not on the server to be advertised, at least not for something unrelated.
4. Do not share NSFW content.
  - There is a lot of content in NSFW content that is likely to be inappropriate. Some people see them as fine, while others dislike them.
5. Do not share personal information.
  - The act of sharing personal information on the Internet is very dangerous. These are rules that are designed to protect you.
6. Do not hate other languages.
  - All languages are allowed on this server. However, it is recommended to use English whenever possible. If someone uses a language you don't know, please use machine translation and actively try to understand it. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/ ':target=_blank')
